# Award Season 
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8acf6ce7-1967-451e-898e-087ecb9d0177/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/award-nominations/deploys)

This project is [live](https://award-nominations.netlify.app/)!

## Introduction
This responsive web application allows you to look up movies from the Open Movie Database and
nominate movies for awards. You can export and view the list of nominations via URLs. This site is a single page application built with React and Material UI. This project is based on Shopify's fontend internship challenge.

Some of the technical challenges in this project include handling query parameters as a means of export and retrieve movies, making reusable component that can be used in multiple parts of the interface, designing where the states locate across multiple components.
